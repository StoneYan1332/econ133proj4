Our project is analyzing the country of Uganda. In this project, we hope to understand the current factors that cause malnutrition across rural Ugandan communities to integrate policies that will fulfill four goals: 

1. Reduce malnutrition (wasting, stunting, underweight, micronutrient deficiencies)
2. Create food security for populations experiencing poverty and low access to agriculture (as a result of climate-related drought)
3. Preserve and improve agricultural land to accommodate future farmland for the benefit of the Ugandan population.
4. Incentivize foreign countries to form trade agreements with Uganda to increase accessibility to more nutritious food options.
