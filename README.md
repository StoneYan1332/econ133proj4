Our project is analyzing the country of Guatemala. In this project, we hope to understand the current factors that cause obesity and malnutrition across Guatemalan communities to integrate policies that will fulfill three goals: 

1. Reduce malnutrition and obesity
2. Create food security for populations experiencing food swamps/food deserts
3. Incentivize foreign countries to form trade agreements with Guatemala to increase accessibility to healthier food options.
